📡 Military Pager Communication System

A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) inspired military pager communication prototype using ESP32, LoRa (SX1278), and LCD interfaces.
The system enables secure, long-range, low-power message exchange between field nodes and a central base station—without relying on cellular or internet infrastructure.

🛡️ Project Motivation

Modern defense communication demands:

Infrastructure-independent operation

Low power consumption

Long-range connectivity

Secure and reliable messaging

This project revives the military pager concept using CPS principles, making it suitable for remote, tactical, and emergency environments.

🧠 System Overview

The system consists of:

Two Field Nodes (Soldier Units)

One Base Station (Command Unit)

All devices communicate using LoRa, ensuring robustness in low-connectivity or hostile environments.

🔗 Communication Flow
Node 1  ⇄  Base Station  ⇄  Node 2


Messages are routed through the base station using a structured packet format and validated using CRC.

🔧 Hardware Components
Component	Description
ESP32	Main controller (dual-core, low power, SPI/I2C support)
LoRa SX1278 / SX1276	Long-range wireless communication
16×2 LCD / I2C LCD	Message display at nodes
433/868 MHz Antenna	Improves communication range
Push Buttons & LEDs	Message trigger and status indication
5V Power Supply	USB-powered prototype
🧩 Software & Tools

Arduino IDE

ESP32 Board Support Package

LoRa Library (SX127x)

KiCad – Circuit design & simulation

C/C++ (Embedded Programming)

📦 Message Packet Format

Each message follows a standardized structure:

TransID : SenderID : ReceiverID : Message

Example:
B:1:2:Send Backup

Field	Meaning
TransID	B = Base Station, N = Node
SenderID	Transmitting node ID
ReceiverID	Destination node ID
Message	Command / Text
